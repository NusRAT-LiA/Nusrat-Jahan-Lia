                I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at MIT, where I direct the Human-AI Learning Lab. My
                research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and
                educational technology, with a focus on creating AI systems that enhance rather than replace human
                learning.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before joining MIT, I completed my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University under the guidance of Dr. Emma
                Chen, where I developed novel approaches to adaptive learning systems that respect student privacy while
                providing personalized educational experiences. My work has been published in top-tier venues including
                CHI, CSCW, and Nature Machine Intelligence.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond academia, I am passionate about translating research into real-world impact. In 2023, I founded
                EduTech Labs, a startup that develops AI-powered tools for educators and students. Our flagship product,
                LearnAdapt, is used by over 50,000 students across 200 institutions worldwide.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not researching or teaching, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new cuisines. I believe
                that diverse experiences outside of work fuel creativity and innovation in research.
